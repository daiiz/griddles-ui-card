/**
 * polymer-overlay displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts
 * out hidden and is displayed by setting it's opened property to true.
 * A polymer-overlay's opened state can be toggled by calling the toggle
 * method.
 * 
 * It's common to want a polymer-overlay to animate to its opened
 * position. A number of helper css classes provide some basic open/close
 * animations. For example, assigning the class polymer-overlay-fade to a
 * polymer-overlay will make it fade into and out of view as it opens and
 * closes. Note, if multiple polymer-overlay's are opened, they should
 * stack on top of each other.
 * 
 * Styling: The size and position of a polymer-overlay should be setup
 * via css.
 * polymer-overlay is natually sized around its content. When a
 * polymer-overlay is opened it is shown and the 'opened' class is added
 * to it. This is typically where css transitions and animations are
 * applied. When the polymer-overlay is closed, the 'opened' class is
 * removed and a 'closing' class is added. Use 'closing' to customize
 * the closing animation. 
 * 
 * Classes for animating polymer-overlay:
 * 
 * * polymer-overlay-fade: fade in/out when opened/closed
 * * polymer-overlay-scale-slideup: open: fade in and shrink;
 * close: slide up
 * * polymer-overlay-shake: open: fly in and shake; close: shake and
 * fly out.
 *
 * It's common to use polymer-overlay to gather user input, for example
 * a login dialog. To facilitate this, polymer-overlay supports automatic
 * focusing of a specific element when it's opened. The element to be
 * focused should be given an autofocus attribute.
 * 
 * An element that should close the polymer-overlay will automatically
 * do so if it is given the overlay-toggle attribute. Please note that
 * polymer-overlay will close whenever the user taps outside it or
 * presses the escape key. The behavior can be turned off via the
 * autoCloseDisabled property.
 * 
 *     <div>
 *       <polymer-overlay></polymer-overlay>
 *       <h2>Dialog</h2>
 *       <input placeholder="say something..." autofocus>
 *       <div>I agree with this wholeheartedly.</div>
 *       <button overlay-toggle>OK</button>
 *     </div>
 * 
 * @class polymer-overlay
